    "Ans :-  Iterator - Iterators are used mostly to iterate or convert other objects to an iterator using iter() function.\n",

    "Ans :-   \n",
    "    Map calls and list comprehension are almost same except in map we call func and in list comprehension function is itself defines \n",
    "    List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n",
    "    List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\n",
    "    List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list.\n",
    "    List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express"
